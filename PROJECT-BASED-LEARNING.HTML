                            <p>Encouraging curiosity and exploration lays the foundation for robust Project-Based Learning (PBL) at Triza Junior School. By fostering curiosity, students are naturally inclined to ask questions, driving their interest in project topics and exploration of diverse ideas. This innate curiosity fuels the initiation of projects, leading to deeper engagement and ownership of their learning process. <br>

                                Moreover, exploration nurtures critical thinking and problem-solving skills as students navigate through project challenges independently or in teams. It instills a sense of inquiry, allowing them to explore various solutions and approaches, fostering creativity and innovation along the way. <br>
                                
                                Within a PBL framework, encouraging curiosity creates an environment where students take the lead in their learning journey. As they delve into topics of interest, their enthusiasm grows, leading to higher motivation levels and a deeper understanding of the subject matter. <br>
                                
                                Furthermore, when curiosity is embraced, students tend to seek connections between different disciplines, promoting interdisciplinary learning within projects. This holistic approach encourages them to apply knowledge from various subjects, enhancing their comprehension and retention of information.</p>

                            <p>Nurturing creativity and innovation serves as a catalyst for advancing Project-Based Learning (PBL) at Triza Junior School.
