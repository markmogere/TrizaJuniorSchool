    <p>In today's educational landscape, the role of ICT in schools is paramount, especially concerning the evolving needs of 21st-century learning. Students are immersed in a world of new devices, trends, and lifestyles, demanding advanced readiness and exposure to navigate the ever-expanding technological realm. Institutions integrating ICT into instruction and embracing learner-centered approaches witness notable enhancements in learning outcomes. <br>

      Recognizing ICT as a necessity, rather than a choice, our school has taken decisive steps to address this imperative. Our commitment to becoming a leading ICT integrator is evident across various spheres: <br>
      
      In the Classrooms: Every classroom, from PP I  to Grade 6, embodies a multimedia-driven environment. Equipped with full-time internet, state-of-the-art projectors, networked computers complemented by sub-woofer sound systems, and interactive whiteboards/projection screens, these setups have revolutionized the traditional teacher-student dynamic, fostering a holistic learning experience enriched by videos, music, sounds, images, and an array of multimedia streaming. <br>
      
      ICT Labs: With dedicated ICT labs for both KG and Primary levels, learners engage hands-on with computers, cameras, and other devices. Ensuring a one-child-one-computer ratio, these tailored lessons prepare students not just for an ICT-aware society but also equip them to tackle the ensuing challenges. It's more than an education; it's a journey of exploring the world through screens. <br>
     
      
      Full-time Internet Access: Partnering with a reputable internet service provider, our school ensures reliable and continuous internet access in classrooms, labs, and offices. Staff equipped with Wi-Fi-enabled devices benefit from hotspot access, enriching their content delivery by staying updated with the latest information. <br>
      
      Adopting Online Applications: Embracing online platforms like Seesaw and Google Class enables seamless sharing of learning experiences with parents and guardians at home. Through these platforms, students offer feedback on home-based activities, fostering collaboration with teachers remotely, thereby enriching their learning journey. <br>
      
      Our department's aspiration is to equip learners to meet the escalating challenges of ICT while ensuring an enjoyable and enriching educational experience. Upholding our school motto, 'Education is Light,' we continuously adapt to ensure our students receive the best from a well-developed education system.</p>
